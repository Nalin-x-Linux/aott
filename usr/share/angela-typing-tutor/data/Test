Tell a story.

Lion lives in forest.
Rabbits can run fast.
Mother is milking cow.
I drink milk everyday.
Though the police man chased the thief he could not catch him.
When mother came child stopped crying.
Where is your basket?
Earth is the most beautiful planet in the solar system.
All that glitters is not gold. Sun rises in the east. 
There are eight planets in the solar system.
India is my country.
